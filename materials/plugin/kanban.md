# Kanban
The Kanban plugin in Obsidian is a community plugin that allows you to create markdown-backed Kanban boards in Obsidian. Kanban boards are a visual way of organizing tasks, projects, or workflows using columns and cards. You can drag and drop cards between columns, add checklists, due dates, tags, links, and more to your cards. You can also link your Kanban boards to other notes in Obsidian, or embed them in other notes.
