# Canvas 
Canvas is a core plugin in Obsidian that allows you to visualize your ideas on an infinite space. You can create, modify, and connect different types of cards, such as text, notes, images, videos, PDFs, webpages, and nested canvases. You can also zoom, pan, scroll, select, and arrange cards in various ways. Canvas is designed to be extensible, interoperable, and durable¬π¬≤.
