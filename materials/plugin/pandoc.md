# Pandoc
Pandoc is a tool that converts documents between different formats, such as Markdown, HTML, PDF, and Word. Obsidian is a note-taking app that uses Markdown as its default format. Pandoc Obsidian is a plugin that allows you to export your notes from Obsidian to various formats using Pandoc. 

The benefits of using Pandoc Obsidian are:

- You can write presentations, draft books, make webpages, and write assignments all in Markdown, and export to whichever format you fancy, all without leaving Obsidian.
- You can use Pandoc templates and citations to customize and enhance your output documents.
- You can combine or concatenate multiple notes into one document for easier export.

To use Pandoc Obsidian, you need to install Pandoc on your computer and make sure it is accessible on your path. Then you need to install the Pandoc Obsidian plugin from the Obsidian community plugins. After that, you can use the command palette to choose your export format and options.

For more information on how to install and use Pandoc Obsidian, you can check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OliverBalfour/obsidian-pandoc), the [Obsidian Hub guide](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/04+-+Guides%2C+Workflows%2C+%26+Courses/Guides/Using+Pandoc+inside+Obsidian), or the [Obsidian plugin page](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-pandoc).
