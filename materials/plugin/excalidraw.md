# The Excalidraw plugin

The Excalidraw plugin in Obsidian is a community plugin that allows you to create and edit hand-drawn diagrams, sketches, and notes in Obsidian. Excalidraw is an open-source online tool that simulates the experience of sketching on a whiteboard. You can use Excalidraw to create flowcharts, mind maps, wireframes, illustrations, and more. You can also link your Excalidraw drawings to other notes in Obsidian, or embed them in other notes.
