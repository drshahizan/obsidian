## Data Sources

* **Frontmatter:** Dataview pulls information from the YAML metadata at the top of your notes. Think of it as structured data about your notes.
* **Inline Fields:** You can embed key-value pairs directly within your notes for more granular data management.
* **Tags:** Tags can be used for filtering and grouping data.

## Querying and Manipulation

* **DataView Query Language:** This powerful language allows you to filter, sort, and aggregate data across your vault. It's similar to SQL but easier to learn.
* **Inline Fields:** Use double-colon syntax to display specific data points from other notes directly within your text.
* **Dashboards:** Create dynamic dashboards that automatically update based on your queries.

## Benefits

* **Improved Organization:** Find specific notes easily, filter by categories, and identify relationships between notes.
* **Automated Tasks:** Generate to-do lists, track progress, and create reports automatically.
* **Enhanced Insights:** Analyze trends, identify patterns, and uncover hidden connections within your notes.
