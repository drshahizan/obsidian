# Obsidian Plugins

**Obsidian** is a powerful note-taking and knowledge management application that allows users to create and organize their notes in a **flexible and interconnected** manner. One of its standout features is the ability to **extend its functionality** through **plugins**. Let's dive into what these plugins are and how they enhance the Obsidian experience:

## **What Are Obsidian Plugins?**
   - **Plugins** in Obsidian are **add-ons** created by the community to **customize and enhance** the application.
   - They allow users to **extend** Obsidian's features, adapt it to their specific needs, and create a **customized note-taking experience**.
   - With hundreds of plugins available, you can tailor Obsidian to fit your personal workflow.

## How to Find and Install Obsidian Plugins
