# Obsidian Plugins

**Obsidian** is a powerful note-taking and knowledge management application that allows users to create and organize their notes in a **flexible and interconnected** manner. One of its standout features is the ability to **extend its functionality** through **plugins**. Let's dive into what these plugins are and how they enhance the Obsidian experience:

## **What Are Obsidian Plugins?**
   - **Plugins** in Obsidian are **add-ons** created by the community to **customize and enhance** the application.
   - They allow users to **extend** Obsidian's features, adapt it to their specific needs, and create a **customized note-taking experience**.
   - With hundreds of plugins available, you can tailor Obsidian to fit your personal workflow¬π.

## Types of Plugins:
### Core Plugins
Core plugins are the plugins that come installed with Obsidian, a powerful knowledge base application that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. Core plugins are officially built and supported by the Obsidian team, and they provide various functionalities to enhance your note-taking experience. Some core plugins are disabled by default, and you can enable them under **Settings ‚Üí Core plugins**. Some examples of core plugins are:

- **Audio recorder**: This plugin allows you to record audio notes and embed them in your Markdown files.
- **Daily notes**: This plugin creates a new note for each day, and lets you quickly navigate between them.
- **File recovery**: This plugin saves snapshots of your notes every few minutes, and lets you restore them in case of accidental deletion or corruption.
- **Format converter**: This plugin converts notes from other platforms, such as Evernote, Roam Research, Notion, etc., into Markdown format.
- **Graph view**: This plugin shows a graphical representation of the links between your notes, and lets you explore your knowledge base visually.
- **Sync**: This plugin synchronizes your notes across multiple devices, using end-to-end encryption.

You can learn more about the core plugins and their settings from the [Obsidian Help page](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Core+plugins).

### Community plugins 

Community plugins are the plugins that are made by other Obsidian users, and they offer various features and integrations that are not available in the core plugins. You can install them from the **Settings ‚Üí Community plugins** menu, or browse them from the [Obsidian Plugins page](https://obsidian.md/plugins). There are over 1,000 community plugins that you can choose from, depending on your needs and preferences. Some examples of community plugins are:

- **Zotero integration**: This plugin allows you to import and manage your Zotero references in Obsidian, and insert citations and bibliographies in your notes.
- **Dataview**: This plugin lets you query and manipulate your notes using a SQL-like language, and display the results in tables or lists.
- **Quick add**: This plugin enables you to quickly create new notes, append text to existing notes, or run commands using customizable templates and hotkeys.
- **Commander**: This plugin adds a command palette that lets you search and execute any Obsidian command, plugin command, or custom script.
- **ABC Music Notation**: This plugin renders music sheets directly from code blocks using ABC music notation via abcjs.
