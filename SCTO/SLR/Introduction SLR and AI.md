A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a method of synthesizing and evaluating the existing research on a specific topic or question. It involves defining a clear research question, searching for relevant studies, selecting and appraising the quality of the studies, extracting and analyzing the data, and reporting the findings¹.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science that aims to create machines or systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and decision making².

AI can be used to assist and automate some of the tasks involved in SLRs, such as:

- Searching for relevant studies: AI can use natural language processing and information retrieval techniques to understand the research question and query different databases and sources to retrieve potentially relevant studies³.
- Screening and selecting studies: AI can use machine learning and text mining techniques to classify and rank the retrieved studies based on their relevance and quality, and to suggest inclusion and exclusion criteria³⁴.
- Extracting and synthesizing data: AI can use natural language processing and knowledge representation techniques to extract and structure the data from the selected studies, such as the study design, population, intervention, outcome, and results, and to synthesize the data using meta-analysis or qualitative methods³⁵.
- Reporting and updating the findings: AI can use natural language generation and summarization techniques to generate and update the report of the SLR, such as the abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion sections³ .

AI can help researchers conduct SLRs more efficiently and accurately, by reducing the time and effort required, increasing the coverage and quality of the studies, and enhancing the transparency and reproducibility of the process³. However, AI also poses some challenges and limitations for SLRs, such as:

- Data quality and bias: AI depends on the quality and representativeness of the data used to train and test the algorithms, and if the data is incomplete, inaccurate, or biased, the AI may produce unreliable or unfair results³ .
- Lack of transparency and explainability: AI algorithms may be complex and opaque, making it difficult for humans to understand how they make their decisions, and to verify and validate their results³ .
- Limited coverage and generalization: AI algorithms may not be able to handle all types of scientific literature, such as non-English, non-textual, or non-standardized formats, and they may not be able to generalize to different domains, topics, or questions³ .
- Ethical and social implications: AI may raise ethical and social issues for SLRs, such as the potential for misuse, abuse, or manipulation of the results, the need for human oversight and involvement, and the impact on the roles and responsibilities of the researchers³ .

Therefore, AI should be used with caution and care in SLRs, and it should be complemented by human expertise and judgment, to ensure the validity, reliability, and credibility of the SLRs³ .
