### ℹ Background information, Prerequisites

> [!quote|blue]+ Highlight ([page. 1666](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y367U56A?page=1666&annotation=5FJ4G9J4))
> Conoscenti et al. [6] conducted a systematic review on Blockchain and IoT – the papers in the area at the time focused primarily on Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency powered by Blockchain. This was due to the limited amount of literature on Blockchain and IoT at the time of writing. In the last few years the level of academic and industrial advancements within the Blockchain of Things has grown substantially. 

### ❓ Assumptions, Questions, Goals, Problems

> [!quote|green]+ Highlight ([page. 1666](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y367U56A?page=1666&annotation=FCCIW4YK))
> Several predominant challenges exist that need tackling to enable the Blockchain of Things including the limited computing and storage capability of IoT devices, the intensive computational requirements of Blockchain and the decentralized design of security to meet the Blockchain of Things (BIoT) architecture, adhoc connectivity, and trust among others. Because Blockchain and IoT are both recent and their combination is nowadays actively researched topic we found it very important to conduct a systematic literature review to get an overview the current state-of-theart. 

### 📊 Main findings, Results, Conclusions

> [!quote|purple]+ Highlight ([page. 1666](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y367U56A?page=1666&annotation=WRGU2HSW))
> We gather and prepare the relevant literature to provide an overview of the existing work from different perspectives. Firstly, we identify the application areas presented within the literature and look for possible correlation against the variety of Blockchain platforms used in the literature. Secondly, we study the contribution of the literature and discuss the widely addressed research objectives. Based on the statistical and exploratory analysis we outline any research gaps and possibility for further research. 

### 🧪Experimental details or Methods

> The Internet of Things (IoT) is a name coined to the digital ecosystem of numerous internet connected devices. It brings the physical world closer to the digital one and as a result, allows for new applications and services. The emergence of Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, presents a possible solution to ensure trust in decentralized systems. Blockchain brings trust, immutability, and verifiability of a distributed ledger in a decentralized network which could be useful to build trust in IoT 

### ⭐ Interesting point, Facts, Examples

> [!quote|yellow]+ Highlight ([page. 1666](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y367U56A?page=1666&annotation=TUKVS6GL))
> However, the integration of IoT with Blockchain involves a number of challenges. The use of Blockchain within the IoT is a recent and a fast paced topic. Therefore, conducting a systematic literature review is essential to understand what has been proposed on the topic. Recent work has provided a systematic review with a focus on Bitcoin 

### 📅 Vocabulary, Names, Dates, Definitions

> [!quote|grey]+ Highlight ([page. 1666](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y367U56A?page=1666&annotation=EFT4DWJ2))
> The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to systems of physical devices and computing platforms connected via the Internet. While the Internet part of the IoT is obvious the Things includes devices such as sensors, actuators, computers, mobile phones, and users that interact with other devices, (i.e. humans or devices). Blockchain is a disruptive technology that maintains a single ledger of transactions in a decentralized and distributed network. Blockchain ensures that the ledger cannot be tampered with, and that all data is verifiable. The integration of Blockchain with IoT can enable the automation of physical processes amongst decentralised devices in a verifiable and trusted manner.
